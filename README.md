## 🏛️ Architecture


## 📜 Data
- We collected **194 images** spanning 6 fruit categories: **Apples, Strawberries, Kiwis, Lemons, Oranges**, and an **Unknown** type.

- Each image was annotated using **LabelMe** to generate individual JSON files.  
   - These annotations include:
     - Bounding boxes.
     - Object categories.

- The images are in `./dataset/`.  

## 🧠 Model
The fruit detection model is built using **Faster R-CNN** with the [**Detectron2**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) library.

### 🗂️ **Data Annotation: Transformation to COCO Format**

To facilitate the integration of annotated data with the model, we converted individual **LabelMe JSON files** into a single **COCO JSON file** useful for object detection and segmentation tasks.

#### **Process**   

1. **Transformation**:  
   - The **labelme2coco** tool was used to combine all LabelMe JSON files  into a single **COCO JSON file**. 
   ```bash
   pip install -U labelme2coco
   labelme2coco path/to/labelme/dir  #for individual json files
   ```
   
2. **COCO JSON Structure**:  
   The resulting COCO file contains:  
   - **Images**: The paths and metadata of all annotated images.  
   - **Annotations**: Bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and associated categories.  
   - **Categories**: Labels for the detected objects (e.g., Apples, Strawberries, etc.).

### 🧠 **Model Architecture**

We implemented the **Faster R-CNN** model with a **ResNet-50** backbone and **Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)** for fruit detection and classification.

#### **1. Feature Extraction and Multi-Scale Representation**
<div align="center">
    <img src="./images/Feature_Extraction_and_FPN.png" alt="Fruit Detection and Classification Process" width="70%">
</div>

- **Backbone - ResNet-50**  
   - Extracts essential features from the input images using convolutional layers.  
   - At each layer, the image resolution is divided by 2, allowing for a detailed analysis at multiple scales.  

-  **Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)**  
   - Enhances the feature maps generated by ResNet-50 by combining features at different resolutions.  
   - Produces **multi-scale feature maps** that allow the model to detect fruits of various sizes effectively.  

#### **2. Fruit Detection and Classification Process**
<div align="center">
    <img src="./images/Fruit_Detection_and_Classification_Process.png" alt="Fruit Detection and Classification Process" width="70%">
</div>

1. **Region Proposal Network (RPN)**:  
   - The FPN-generated feature maps are used to propose potential regions (RoIs) where fruits might be located.  
   - Each proposal is assigned an **objectiveness score** to filter irrelevant regions.  

2. **RoI Pooling**:  
   - Valid regions are normalized and resized to a fixed size.  
   - This ensures consistent input for further processing.

3. **Classification and Refinement**:  
   - Fully connected layers analyze each **RoI** to:  
     - Determine the **class** of the detected object (e.g., Apple, Strawberry).  
     - Refine the **bounding box** around the fruit for precise localization.

4. **Final Output**:  
   - The model outputs an image annotated with **bounding boxes** around each detected fruit and its corresponding classification label.  
   - The total number of fruits is determined by counting the bounding boxes.

### 📈 **Training and Output**

1. **Training Environment**:  
   - The model was trained on **Google Colab** using the notebook file:  
     - `./P2M.ipynb` (adapted from Detectron2's "Getting Started" notebook).  

2. **Dataset**:  
   - The training dataset provided in this repository (`./dataset`) was:
     - Converted to **COCO JSON format**.  
     - Processed using custom Python scripts to adjust minor details.  

3. **Validation**:  
   - The validation dataset (`./dataset/val`) underwent the same processing pipeline as the training data.

4. **Output**:  
   - The final output is a **trained weight model file** stored at:  
     - `./detectron2/model_path`.  

   - This model is used for inference to detect, classify, and count fruits accurately.

## 🔗 **Model Integration**  
The trained model is integrated into the application via **FastAPI**, enabling real-time fruit detection and classification.

### **Model Path**  
- The **trained model weights** are stored in:  
   - `./detectron2/model_path/model_final.pth`.  
- The weights are loaded during **FastAPI server startup** to enable quick inference.  

### **Model Inference**  
1. **Testing and Visualization**:  
   - After training on **Google Colab**, the model was locally tested using a **Python script** (`./detectron2/P2M.py`).  
   - The visualization functions were adapted to validate predictions on test images and ensure proper detection and classification.

2. **Integration with FastAPI**:  
   - The same functions and model are used in the **FastAPI server** (`./detetron2/fastapi_code.py`) to provide an API interface for the trained model.  
   - This enables real-time predictions and seamless backend integration.

### **Endpoints**  
- **`/analyze`**: Accepts input images and processes them using the trained model to detect and classify fruits.  
- **`/get_analyzed_image/{filename}`**: Retrieves processed images with **bounding boxes** drawn around the detected fruits.

### **Data Flow**  
1. **Frontend (Flutter)**:  
   - The user uploads an image via the mobile application.  
   - The image is sent to the FastAPI backend.

2. **Backend (FastAPI)**:  
   - The FastAPI server loads the trained model.  
   - The image is processed, and the results (e.g., bounding boxes, classifications) are returned to the frontend.

3. **History Storage (MongoDB)**:  
   - The results are stored in **MongoDB** for tracking and management.

## 🛠️ **Node.js Express Backend**

The **backend** is developed using **Node.js** with the **Express.js framework**. It connects to a MongoDB database to handle fruit history data and provides the following endpoints:

### **API Endpoints**

1. **`GET/POST /nodejs/api/history`**  
   - Retrieve all histories or create a new history.  

2. **`GET /nodejs/api/history/os`**  
   - Fetch the **OS hostname** where the service is running.  

3. **`GET /nodejs/api/history/live`**  
   - Check if the server is live.

### **Running the Backend Alone**

To run the backend independently:

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a **.env** file and define the following variables:
  ```.env
   MONGO_BASE_URI=<your_mongodb_url>
   DB_NAME=fruitvision
   MONGO_USERNAME=<your_mongodb_username>
   MONGO_PASSWORD=<your_mongodb_password>
   ```
3. Start the server:
  ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
4. Access the API:

  - http://localhost:5000/nodejs/api/history (Main endpoint).

> [!NOTE]
> Note that this step only applies if you would like to run the backend independently and use your own mongodatabase. We define one in the docker compose file

## 🐳 Dockerization

The project is fully containerized with **Docker** to ensure portability and scalability. Two Docker images are built and pushed to Docker Hub:

- **`hiba25/backend`**: For the Node.js backend.  
- **`hiba25/modele`**: For the FastAPI model.

## ☁️ Deployment Using Terraform

### **Goal**
The goal of using **Terraform** is to automate and provision the infrastructure required for deploying the **FruitVision application**. Terraform ensures consistency, scalability, and seamless management of cloud resources.

Using **Terraform**, we successfully automated the deployment of a Virtual Machine and networking configurations. This ensured a scalable and secure infrastructure for our application, ready for deployment of services like the Node.js backend, Mongo database and FastAPI model.


1. **Infrastructure Definition**:  
   - We defined and automated the infrastructure using Terraform files (`main.tf`, `network.tf`, `vm-provisioner.tf`).
   - Resources include:
     - **Virtual Machines (VMs)** for running services.
     - **Networking** configurations (VNet, Subnet, Security Groups) to manage communication.
     - Public IP setup for external access.

2. **Docker Compose Integration**:  
   - The **public IP** of the deployed VM is dynamically updated in the **Docker Compose file** to configure the `BASE_URL` for running the FastAPI model.

3. **SSH Key Configuration**:  
   - We set up **SSH key-pairs** to enable secure access to the provisioned virtual machines.

4. **State and Outputs**:  
   - Terraform outputs the necessary details like the **Public IP** of the deployed instances for quick access.
